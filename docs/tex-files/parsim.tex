\chapter{Simulation on multi-core computers}
The conservative simulator from prior versions of adevs has been replaced with a much simpler (and, I hope, more useful) parallel simulator that executes simultaneous state transitions in parallel. This simulation options is enabled by default when you compile with OpenMP enabled. For your model to work correctly, it is required that the state transition functions of your atomic models be threadsafe. The number of threads to use in a simulation run can be controlled with the environment variable OMP\_NUM\_THREADS. For large models executed with a small number of threads you may see some speedup relative to a single threaded execution. However, this modest speedup comes at no additional development effort on your part 8-).
