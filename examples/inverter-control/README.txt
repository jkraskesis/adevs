This example simulates an inverter based control
for harmonic compensation in an electrical power
system. The sim.cpp file simulates a case for
a simple set of parameter.s The opt.cpp file tries
to optimize the parameter selection such that the
60 Hz signal is diminished as little as possible
while eliminating the harmonic and keeping the
broad band noise small.
