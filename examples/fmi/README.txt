This directory contains several examples of how to use the FMI
import feature. These examples were built using the OpenModelica
compiler and its FMI2 export facilities.

To run these examples you will need OpenModelica and the FMI
for model exchange header files. You can get these from

http://www.openmodelica.org
https://www.fmi-standard.org/downloads#version2

You will need to edit the build scripts in each example to
point to your installation of the FMI2 header files.
