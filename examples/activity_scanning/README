The files des.cpp and des.h contain an activity scanning
simulation framework that is built on top of a DEVS atomic
model. The simulation approach is described in the upcoming
book "Model Engineering for Simulation" to be published by
Elsevier. Examples of models that use the framework are
in the files test*.cpp.
