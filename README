---- C++ -----
The simulation is implemented primarily as a set of C++ header files,
and for many applications it is sufficient to use just those. You can
build the rest of the simulation library with the command by changing
to the 'src' directory and running 'make'. The compiler options in the
makefile should work for the GNU g++ compiler. You may need to set
other options for other Unix based compilers. OpenMP support is assumed
by default.

For Visual Studio and Windows, open a command shell, go the the 'src'
directory, and run the batch file 'build.bat'. This will create a 
static library to link with your application. The build script does
not include any OpenMP options, so those must be added to the compiler
switches if you want it (the Express versions of Visual Studio don't
support OpenMP in any case).

---- Java -----
To build the java bindings, go the the 'src' directory and then edit the
Makefile so that JAVA_HOME points to your jdk installation. The run
'make java_adevs' to build the shared library libjava_adevs.so and the
jar file adevs.jar. To use these, put the shared library into your LD_LIBRARY_PATH
and the jar file into your CLASSPATH.

For Windows, you can use the prebuilt java_adevs.dll and adevs.jar by putting
the former into your PATH and the latter into your CLASSPATH. The adevs_jni/build.bat
script has all of the commands needed to build these from scratch if you choose
to do so (or if you got this from the svn repository).
